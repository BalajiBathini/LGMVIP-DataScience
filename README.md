## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Classification

- **Project Folder**: [iris-flower-classification](https://github.com/<your-username>/LGMVIP-DataScience/tree/main/iris-flower-classification)
- **Description**: This project focuses on the classification of Iris flowers using the famous Iris dataset. It involves exploring the dataset, performing data preprocessing, and training a machine learning model to predict the species of the Iris flower based on its petal and sepal measurements.

### 2. Stock Price Prediction

- **Project Folder**: [stock-price-prediction](https://github.com/<your-username>/LGMVIP-DataScience/tree/main/stock-price-prediction)
- **Description**: In this project, we aim to predict stock prices using historical stock data. It involves collecting stock data, performing data analysis, applying various machine learning techniques, and evaluating the performance of the models. The project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting.

### 3. Image to Pencil Sketch Conversion

- **Project Folder**: [image-to-pencil-sketch](https://github.com/<your-username>/LGMVIP-DataScience/tree/main/image-to-pencil-sketch)
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the conversion of an image to a pencil sketch using image processing techniques. It involves loading an image, applying various filters and transformations, and saving the resulting pencil sketch image. The project utilizes libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset

- **Project Folder**: [eda-terrorism-dataset](https://github.com/<your-username>/LGMVIP-DataScience/tree/main/eda-terrorism-dataset)
- **Description**: In this project, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset. It involves analyzing the dataset, extracting insights, and visualizing the patterns and trends related to terrorist activities. The project aims to gain a better understanding of the data and provide useful insights.

### 5. Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Flower Classification

- **Project Folder**: [decision-tree-iris-classification](https://github.com/<your-username>/LGMVIP-DataScience/tree/main/decision-tree-iris-classification)
- **Description**: This project focuses on using a Decision Tree classifier for Iris flower classification. It involves training a Decision Tree model on the Iris dataset, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the decision tree structure. The project demonstrates the use of Decision Trees for classification tasks.
